      <p id="intro">Back in old Portland, Oregon, a model of the Solar System was constructed to scale.  The Sun and all the planets were shown in locations throughout the city.  The Sun was identified as the orange chimney at OMSI, approximately 9 feet, 1 inch in diameter.  The planets and our moon were spheres of mineral or concrete.  The Portland Solar System covered 150 square miles in Portland.  Sites were chosen for accurate scale distance from the Sun, as well as for scenic views of the city.  Touring the Solar System in Portland provided both an experience of the immense distances and powerful gravitational forces of our solar system, and a sense of the variety and beauty of Portland landscapes and panoramic views.  The Sun and the first five planets could be seen on a walking tour.  The remaining planets could be visited by car, bicycle, or bus.  Today some of these planets remain and some are lost.  This site aims to call attention to the past and encourage a revival of the Pdx solar system.  Feel free to explore the locations and maybe add a planet yourself!  You can view a printable verrsion of the old guide to the Portland Solar System Model, with maps, driving instructions, bus routes, and photos of the models <a href=file:///Users/Guest/Desktop/pdx-solar-system/img/plaques/mercury-plaque.pdf>here</a> (this is an 800K file).

              miles in space. Light will travel 500 million miles
              in about 45 minutes. The light from the sun takes
              about 8 minutes to reach Earth. If you walk slowly

          <h3> MARS </h3>
          <p>• 4,220 miles in diameter</p>
          <p>o In this model, Mars is ½- inch in
          diameter.</p>
          <p>o Mars has two moons, Phobos and
          Deimos. You will have to imagine
          them in this model because they
          would only be one-thousandth of an
          inch in diameter; Phobos ¾-inch
          away and Deimos 2-inches away</p>
          <p>• 140 million miles from the Sun</p>
          <p>• 1 year, 10 months, 17 days to orbit the Sun</p>
          <p>• In this model Mars is located 1,500 feet
          north of OMSI along the footpath next to the
          Willamette River.</p>
          <p>• The real planet Mars can often be seen as
          bright, reddish spot in the sky at night. It
          has been known since ancient times.
          However, as telescopes developed and more
          details were seen, speculation grew about
          the possibility of intelligent life on Mars.
          Pass under the Hawthorne Bridge and continue
          north along the east bank of the Willamette River.
          The recently constructed Esplanade will give you
          views of downtown Portland and activity on the
          River.
          You are now passing through the asteroid belt. One
          asteroid has been installed. It is a bit of a detour,
          and you may wish to visit it later, on the way to
          Uranus.</p>

          <p>About a mile north of OMSI, about 100 yards
            before the Burnside Bridge stairs, on your right you
            will find:</p>
            <h3>JUPITER<h3>
            <p>Jupiter is an 11 1/4–inch concrete sphere. To see
            the sun, a mile away, climb the stairs to the

            <p>  • Jupiter has been observed since prehistoric
                  times. It was the first planet observed by
              Galileo through the newly invented
              telescope.</p>
            <p>  • The four largest moons, Io, Europa,
              Ganymede and Callisto can be seen with

            to enter Willamette Park. As you enter the park, go
            to the right and find the parking lot and boat ramp.
            To the left of the boat ramp, behind the
            “Landscaping for Clean Rivers” garden, on a tall
            wooden pole, you’ll see:</p>
            <h3>SATURN<h3>
              <p>Saturn is a 9 ½-inch concrete sphere. The Sun
              can be seen 1 ½ miles away.</p>

              Through a small telescope, the rings can be
              seen, as well as the four largest moons,
              Titan, Rhea, Iapetus, and Dione.</p>
            <p>  Before continuing on, look east to Ross Island and
              you may be fortunate enough to see Great Blue
              Heron nesting in the trees or lurking over the river.</p>

            <p>Ismene is five thousandth of an inch in diameter and
            located 4,500 feet from the Sun. It is shown on a 2-
            inch diameter brass plate next to the entry walk at
            707 SE 12th, just north of Belmont SE. Sometimes
            it is covered with leaves or grass, but it is about
            midway down the walk, on the north side.</p>

          <p>After seeing Ismene, continue east on Belmont to
          SE 69th</p>
          <p>. Walk or drive up 69th to Mount Tabor
          Park, turn right and go up the hill to the stop, left at the stop sign,
          wind your way past the playground to a parking
          spot. Leave your car, go up the stairs to the left of
          the parking lot to the non-vehicle road at the top of
          Mount Tabor. Go to the right, and you will find
          Uranus on the third pole, overlooking Portland.</p>
          <h3>URANUS</h3>
            <p>Uranus is a 4-inch concrete sphere. The Sun can
            be seen 3 ½ miles away.</p>
            <p>• 31,700 miles in diameter</p>
            <p>o In this model, Uranus is 4 inches in

            <p>• 1,780 million miles from the sun</p>
            <p>• 84 years to orbit the sun</p>
            <p>• Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William
            <p>Herschel using a homemade telescope.</p>
            <p>Uranus is unusual in that its rotation is tilted
            about 90 degrees from its plane of orbit.</p>
            <p>Mount Tabor is a heavily wooded extinct volcano
            with a magnificent view of Portland between the trees.</p>

          <p>To travel to Neptune, retrace your steps to 69th and
          Yamhill, and continue east on Yamhill, (15 bus)
          which jigs and jogs on its way to 76th</p>
          <p>. Go left on 76th, right on Washington, left on 82nd, and enjoy
          the magic that is 82nd Avenue. Head north on 82nd
          (72 bus) about 2.2 miles to Fremont Street, which is marked with two large
          green signs, one for the Portland Bible College and the other for Honeysuckles Lingerie. Go right on Fremont,(33 bus) veer right at 89th on Benjamin,
          then right on 92nd and on to the stop sign at Russell. Go left up hill just past Russell. Continue up the hill for 1 ¼ miles, passing through the figure-8 tunnel (hey, you’re inside a volcano for about 30 seconds). At the end of the road park at the Rocky Butte Castle, and walk up the ramp or stairs to find:<p>
            <h3> NEPTUNE <H3>
          <p>Neptune is a 3 7/8” concrete sphere. The sun is
          just barely visible 5.6 miles away</p>
          <p>• 30,500 miles in diameter</p>
          <p>• 2,790 million miles from the sun</p>
          <p>• 165 years to orbit the sun</p>
          <p>• The discovery of Neptune was predicted by
          John Couch Adams in 1845 based on
          irregularities of the orbit of Uranus
          (remember the 4 inch sphere 4 miles away
          on Mt. Tabor?) The actual discovery one
          year later was credited to LeVerrier.</p>
          <p>From the top of Rocky Butte you have some of the
          most spectacular views in Portland. Mountains that
          can be seen include Rainier, St. Helens, Adams,
          Hood, and Jefferson. The Columbia River extends
          far in to the Gorge to the east, and meets the
          Willamette to the west. You look down on planes
          landing at Portland International Airport, and see
          the bridges and buildings of Portland, as well as the
          orange chimney at OMSI.</p>

            <p> From the University of Portland main entrance, try to find a parking spot near the bluff. Walk on the grass toward the west and find the gazebo next to the small observatory building. Inside the gazebo you'll see:</p>
            <h3>PLUTO AND CHARON</h3>
            <p>Pluto is ¼” diameter Chrisoprase. Charon is
          a ½” diameter Chrisoprase. The Sun is 5 ½
          miles away, hidden by a bend in the river.</p>
          <p>• 1,920 miles in diameter</p>
          <p>• 3 billion, 700 million miles from the Sun.
          The orbit of Pluto is tilted to the plane of the
          other planets, and also eccentric. Sometimes,
          as in this model, Pluto is closer to the Sun
          than Neptune, crossing its path.</p>
          <p>• 247 years to orbit the Sun
          <p>• Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde
          Tombaugh. He used a relatively new
          technique of comparing photographs of the
          same area of the sky taken at different times.</p>
          <p>• The moon Charon is sometimes considered a
          twin planet with Pluto</p>
          <p>o The moon Charon is 807 miles in
          diameter, 11,800 miles from Pluto</p>
          <p>o In this model, Charon is less than 1/8
          of an inch in diameter, 1 1/2 inches
          away from Pluto</p>
          <p>o Charon and Pluto orbit each other
          every 6 days, 9 hours and 36 minutes</p>
          <p>o Charon was discovered in 1978</p>
