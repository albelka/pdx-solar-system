      <p id="intro">Back in old Portland, Oregon, a model of the Solar System was constructed to scale. The Sun and all the planets were shown in locations throughout the city. The Sun was identified as the orange chimney at OMSI, approximately 9 feet, 1 inch in diameter. The planets and our moon were spheres of mineral or concrete. The Portland Solar System covered 150 square miles in Portland.
      Sites were chosen for accurate scale distance from the Sun, as well as for scenic views of the city. Touring the Solar System in Portland provided both an experience of the immense distances
      and powerful gravitational forces of our solar system, and a sense of the variety and beauty of Portland landscapes and panoramic views.
      The Sun and the first five planets could be seen on a walking tour. The remaining planets could be visited by car, bicycle, or bus.
      Today some of these planets remain and some are lost. This site aims to call attention to the past and encourage a revival of the Pdx solar system.  Feel free to explore the locations and maybe add a planet yourself! You can view a printable verrsion of the old guide to the Portland Solar System Model, with maps, driving instructions, bus routes, and photos of the models <a href=file:///Users/Guest/Desktop/pdx-solar-system/img/plaques/mercury-plaque.pdf>here</a> (this is an 800K file).

            in about 45 minutes. The light from the sun takes
            about 8 minutes to reach Earth. If you walk slowly
            north along the east bank of the Willamette, at about

          <p>  • 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes to orbit the Sun</p>
          <p>  • In this model Earth is located 984 feet north
              of OMSI. It is beyond the maintenance
              building north of OMSI, on a bridge pylon
              next to the asphalt road that runs through the
              gravel parking lot. To see the Sun, step
              back across the asphalt road.</p>
          <p>  • You can simulate a solar eclipse by holding
            a ¼-inch object, such as a pencil eraser at
            arms length, approximately 30 inches.</p>

          <h3> MARS </h3>
          <p>• 4,220 miles in diameter</p>
          <p>o In this model, Mars is ½- inch in
          diameter.</p>
          <p>o Mars has two moons, Phobos and
          Deimos. You will have to imagine
          them in this model because they
          would only be one-thousandth of an
          inch in diameter; Phobos ¾-inch
          away and Deimos 2-inches away</p>
          <p>• 140 million miles from the Sun</p>
          <p>• 1 year, 10 months, 17 days to orbit the Sun</p>
          <p>• In this model Mars is located 1,500 feet
          north of OMSI along the footpath next to the
          Willamette River.</p>
          <p>• The real planet Mars can often be seen as
          bright, reddish spot in the sky at night. It
          has been known since ancient times.
          However, as telescopes developed and more
          details were seen, speculation grew about
          the possibility of intelligent life on Mars.
          Pass under the Hawthorne Bridge and continue
          north along the east bank of the Willamette River.
          The recently constructed Esplanade will give you
          views of downtown Portland and activity on the
          River.
          You are now passing through the asteroid belt. One
          asteroid has been installed. It is a bit of a detour,
          and you may wish to visit it later, on the way to
          Uranus.</p>

          About a mile north of OMSI, about 100 yards
before the Burnside Bridge stairs, on your right you
will find:
JUPITER
          Jupiter is an 11 1/4–inch concrete sphere. To see
the sun, a mile away, climb the stairs to the
Burnside Bridge, about 100 yards north of
Jupiter.
