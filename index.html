    <h1>PDX Solar System</h1>
    <!-- <p>A model of the Solar System has been constructed to scale in Portland, Oregon. The Sun and all the planets are shown to scale. The Sun is the orange chimney at OMSI, approximately 9 feet, 1 inch in diameter. The planets and our moon are spheres of mineral or concrete. They are placed throughout the city at scale distances from the Sun. The Portland Solar System covers 150 square miles in Portland.
    Sites have been chosen for accurate scale distance from the Sun, as well as for scenic views of the city. Touring the Solar System in Portland provides both an experience of the immense distances
    and powerful gravitational forces of our solar system, and a sense of the variety and beauty of Portland landscapes and panoramic views.
    The Sun and the first five planets can be seen on a walking tour. The remaining planets can be visited by car, bicycle, or bus.
    The inner planets and Jupiter can be visited on a walking tour.
    To start the tour, get yourself to OMSI, on the east bank of the Willamette River. From downtown, drive, walk or bike across the Hawthorne Bridge, or take the 83 bus from 5th and Salmon. If you use the bus for the tour, get a $4 all-day pass at the Tri-Met ticket machine at Pioneer Square or 5th & Salmon. Hang on to the ticket, though, because every bus driver asks you to do something different with it.
    Once at OMSI, walk to the Northwest corner of the generator building to see the small black plate identifying the sun. To see the chimney, which represents the sun, follow the curved pathway above
    the riverbank to the Southwest corner of the generator building and look up.</p> -->

See the Portland Solar System in these 15 steps:
Walking:
<div id="sun-directions"> The Chimney at OMSI (the Sun)</div>
<div id ="mercury-directions" In this model Mercury is located 380 feet north of OMSI on a Bridge pylon along the river.
3  Venus is located 710 feet north of OMSI on a bridge pylon at the north end of the OMSI
parking lot.
4. In this model Earth is located 984 feet north of OMSI. It is beyond the maintenance building
north of OMSI, on a bridge pylon next to the asphalt road that runs through the gravel parking lot. To
see the Sun, step back across the asphalt road.
5. Mars is located 1,500 feet north of OMSI along the footpath next to the Willamette River.
6. About a mile north of OMSI, about 100 yards before the Burnside Bridge stairs, on your
right you will find Jupiter.
Bus/Bicycle/Car/Train
7. Go south on Macadam Boulevard through Johns Landing. Get off the bus or turn left at
Nebraska St. to enter Willamette Park. As you enter the park, go to the right and find the parking lot
and boat ramp. To the left of the boat ramp, behind the “Landscaping for Clean Rivers” garden, on a
tall wooden pole, you’ll see Saturn.
8. To get to Uranus, take the number 40 bus back to downtown, and switch to the number 15 to Belmont,
or drive north on Macadam into town, cross the Morrison Bridge to Southeast Portland. You can take a
detour on the left at 12th street and see the asteroid Ismene.
9. The brass plate is next to the entrance at 707 SE 12th, just north of Belmont SE. It may be
covered with leaves or grass. It is about halfway to Uranus, on the north side.
10. After seeing Ismene, continue east on Belmont to SE 69th . Walk or drive up 69 th to Mount Tabor
11. Park(closed to vehicles on Wednesday), turn right and go up the hill to the stop, left at the stop sign,
wind your way past the playground to a parking spot. Leave your car, go up the stairs to the left of the
parking lot to the non-vehicle road at the top of Mount Tabor. Go to the right, and you will find Uranus
on the third pole, overlooking Portland.
12. Walk or drive up 69 th st. to Mount Tabor Park( closed to vehicles on Wednesday), turn right
and go up the hill to the stop, left at the stop sign, wind your way past the playground to a parking spot.
Leave your car, go up the stairs to the left of the parking lot to the non-vehicle road at the top of Mount
Tabor. Go to the right, and you will find Uranus on the third pole, overlooking Portland.
13. Head north on 82 nd (72 bus) about 2.2 miles to Fremont Street, which is marked with two
large green signs, one for the Portland Bible College and the other for Honeysuckles Lingerie. Go right
on Fremont,(33 bus) veer right at 89 th st then onto Benjamin, then right on 92nd and then to the stop
sign at Russell st.. Go left up hill just past Russell st.. Continue up the hill for 1 ¼ miles, passing
through the figure- 8 tunnel (hey, you’re inside a volcano for about 30 seconds). At the end of the road
park at the Rocky Butte Castle, and walk up the ramp or stairs to find Neptune.
14. Leave Rocky Butte on the road 100 yards to the right of the one you arrived on. This road
will get you back to Fremont and the 33 bus. Head west on Fremont, through some recently revitalized
neighborhoods. After about 5 miles, go right on Williams(bus #40), left on Killingsworth, right on
Vancouver, and left on Portland Blvd. Follow Portland Ave to the end and go right on Willamette Blvd.
It curves around the bluff above the Swan Island Shipyards, and turns right at the University of
Portland. Enter at the main entrance, and try to find a parking spot near the bluff. Walk on the grass
towards the west and find the gazebo next to the small, observatory building. Inside the gazebo is Pluto
and Charon.
